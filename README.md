## OVERVIEW
---
In a dynamic classroom setting, a data analytics course unfolded, drawing together a group of motivated learners eager to navigate the realm of data. The curriculum focused on essential tools: Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI, each integral to developing robust analytical skills.

The course began with Microsoft Excel, where students engaged in data manipulation techniques. They quickly learned to clean and organize datasets using functions and pivot tables, gaining proficiency in visualizing their findings through various charts and graphs. Additionally, they explored basic statistical analysis, equipping themselves with essential formulas to identify trends and insights within the data.

Next, the instruction transitioned to SQL, where we delved into the fundamentals of relational databases.  their abilities to write queries, mastering SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. The exploration of joins and aggregations enabled them to effectively summarize and combine data, showcasing the power of SQL in data analysis.

The course culminated with Power BI, a vital tool for creating interactive reports and dashboards. Students connected to diverse data sources, imported datasets, and developed comprehensive data models. They experienced the satisfaction of building dynamic visualizations that transformed their analyses into compelling narratives, fostering collaboration and feedback among peers as they shared their work.
